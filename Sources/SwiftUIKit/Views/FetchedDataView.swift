/**
 This view can be used to present asynchronous data that can
 be either in a loading, fetched or failed state.
 
 By Providing three views to the view, the view will present
 the correct one depending on the state of the data:
 
 * `content` is shown when the optional `data` has a value.
 * `loadingView` is shown when `data` is nil and `isLoading` is true.
 * `noDataView` is shown when `data` is nil and `isLoading` is false.
 
 My intention was for `loadingView` to be optional, but this
 proved problematic. First, the standard `ProgressView` that
 I meant to return is only available on `iOS 14`, `tvOS 14`,
 so I had to use an obscured fallback for older platforms. I
 also had problems making the init param optional, since the
 `LoadingView` is part of the generic and can not be omitted.
