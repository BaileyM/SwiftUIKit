/**
 This view has a front and a back view and can be flipped to
 show the other side when it's tapped, swiped or both.
 
 For now, it only supports horizontal flip, since flipping a
 view both horizontally and vertically can mess it up and is
 not good from a usability point of view, since the view can
 become upside down.
