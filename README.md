## <a name="about"></a>About SwiftUIKit

SwiftUIKit contains additional functionality to SwiftUI; both things that should be in the framework (and most probably will be added later on, in one form or another), extensions to currently existing component as well as custom things that may never (and most probably never will or should be be) be added to SwiftUI.

Read more about the different parts of this library in separate sections:

* [Blur][Blur]

As things in this library are added to SwiftUI, the functionality in this library will be deprecated and refer to the new features in SwiftUI, even if the api:s will differ.



## Demo App

This project contains a demo app that shows all available system blur styles. To run the demo app, just open and run the `SwiftUIKit.xcodeproj` project.
