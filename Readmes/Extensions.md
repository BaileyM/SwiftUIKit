# Extension

`SwiftUIKit` contains extensions to `SwiftUI` types.

Since this namespace will probably grow much, individual extensions are not listed or demonstrated. 

Instead, have a look at the source code to see what kind of extensions this library contains. They should all be pretty well documented.
