# Views

`SwiftUIKit` contains custom views. For now, they are not in the demo.


## DismissableView

This view protocol simplifies programatically dismissing a SwiftUI-based "screen".


## MultilineTextField

This view makes it possible to use multiline text editing to SwiftUI apps.


## UIViewWrapper

This view makes it easy to wrap a `UIKit` view to make it possible to use it in SwiftUI.
