# Pickers

`SwiftUIKit` contains various pickers, which either fills the gaps on some platforms or provides entirely new picking functionality.


## FilePicker

This picker presents a `UIDocumentPickerViewController`, which can be used to pick a file.


## ImagePicker

This picker presents a `UIImagePickerController`, which can be used to pick an image from the photo album.


## Simple Pickers

This `SimpleMultiPicker`, `SimpleSinglePicker` and `SimpleOptionalPicker` views can be used as custom item pickers.

They are especially useful on tvOS, where the standard pickers don't work yet.
